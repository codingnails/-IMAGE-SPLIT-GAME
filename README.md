PROJECT TITLE:- IMAGE SPLIT GAME  (Java Project) 
This is an interesting aptitude game in which the player needs to memorize the uploaded image. The same image is then splitted into squares and shuffled. The player needs to identify the image part which is at its correct position within the given time duration to win the game. Failing in any of the two stated parameters results in losing the game by the player. 
 
1. PROJECT OBJECTIVE 
to increase the memorizing capability as well as accuracy of players. 
to act as a security measure in the system, and 
to break an image in parts which also makes it easier to send. 
 
2. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION 
->In the first Frame, the user uploads the image using JfileChoose.  
-> Then the image is processed -> Split -> Shuffled -> Displayed 
-> The player needs to click on the image which is at the correct position 
-> Only the correct image square is clickable. 

5. APPLICATION 
->People tend to forget the things they have seen or observed and sometimes commit mistake in day to day life. This game is a small mind exercise which let user think about the lately scene image and work on it. 
->It also improves the retention capacity of the people so as to make them remember things for a longer time as well as improves the observing capability of the people as well.  
->GOGGLE has a security step in google form as “captcha”, It also split the images and ask for certain entity from the image. 
->A very large image can be broken down into part and sent individually if sending the whole image is not feasible or difficult. 
->This concept can also be used for sending a confidential image in parts through mails. As it becomes difficult and time consuming to combine the part of an image.
